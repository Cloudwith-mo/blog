# Blog App with Flask

This guide explains how to set up and build a blog app using Flask, a lightweight web framework for Python.

---

## **Step 1: Set Up Your Project Folder**

Create a new directory for your project. This directory will hold all the files related to your blog app, including your Python code, templates, and Markdown posts.

### Commands:
```bash
mkdir blog
cd blog
'''

Inside the blog directory, set up a virtual environment. A virtual environment ensures that your project dependencies don’t interfere with other Python projects.

Command:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
Directory Structure:
bash
Copy code
blog/
├── .venv/  # Virtual environment folder


## **Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment to use the isolated Python environment.

Command (Windows PowerShell):
bash
Copy code
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
Once activated, your terminal prompt will show (.venv) to indicate you’re working inside the virtual environment.
